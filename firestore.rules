/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the WasteWise application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a hierarchical ownership model where departments own their waste applications.
 * Additionally, it provides admin access to all waste applications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /departments/{departmentId}: Stores department information.
 * - /departments/{departmentId}/wasteApplications/{wasteApplicationId}: Stores waste applications submitted by each department.
 * - /roles_admin/{uid}: Stores admin users. Existence of a document indicates admin role.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Departments can only manage their own waste applications.
 * - Admin users can view and manage all waste applications.
 * - The 'id' field must match the document ID for departments and waste applications.
